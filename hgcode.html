                                            headers=get_headers(), json=payload)

        <br>
        This snippet of code tells HeyGen to create a new avatar group.
        <br>
        The function get_headers() returns the necessary header to pass into HeyGen's API in order to be able to utilize it.
        This header includes three parts: "Accept" dictates HeyGen's reponse format, "Content-Type" dictates our request format, and "X-Api-Key" is our API key.
        <br>
        The payload is the data being sent to HeyGen. The variables name and image_key were passed in to the function the avatar generation process is occurring in.
        "name" is what HeyGen will call the avatar, and "image_key" is the identifier pointing to the photo HeyGen should use to create the video.
        <br>
        requests.post uses the requests module to send data to the given URL. In this case, the necessary header and the payload data is being sent.
