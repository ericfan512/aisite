                def get_headers():
                    return {
                        "Accept": "application/json",
                        "Content-Type": "application/json",
                        "X-Api-Key": API_KEY
                    }

                def create_avatar_group(name, image_key):
                    ...
                    payload = {"name": name, "image_key": image_key}
                    ...
                    response = requests.post("https://api.heygen.com/v2/photo_avatar/avatar_group/create",
                                            headers=get_headers(), json=payload)

        <br>
        When these functions are called, this snippet of code tells HeyGen to create a new avatar group.
        <br>
        The function get_headers() returns the necessary header to pass into HeyGen's API in order to be able to utilize it.
        This header includes three parts: "Accept" dictates HeyGen's reponse format, "Content-Type" dictates our request format, and "X-Api-Key" is our API key.
        <br>
        The payload is the data being sent to HeyGen. The variables name and image_key were passed in to the function the avatar generation process is occurring in.
        "name" is what HeyGen will call the avatar, and "image_key" is the identifier pointing to the photo HeyGen should use to create the video.
        <br>
        requests.post uses the requests module to send data to the given URL. In this case, the necessary header and the payload data is being sent.

                def train_avatar_group(group_id):

                                            headers=get_headers(), json=payload)
                    if response.status_code == 200:
                        data = response.json()
                        if data.get("error") is None:
                            return True, "Training started successfully"
                        else:
                            return False, f"Error starting training: {data.get('error')}"
                    elif response.status_code == 400:
                        ...
                        return False, "Unable to train avatar. Please check the status of your API key (there are usage limits)."

        <br>
        When this function is called, this snippet of code tells HeyGen to train the avatar with the given group_id.
        <br>
        If HeyGen returns a status code 200 (server received information and can process request) and there is no error, then training has started.
        If there is a status code 400 (server unable to process request) returned, then training is unable to occur (often due to API usage limits).
